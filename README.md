# openmhz_delayed_uploads
Directory watch for delayed uploads to OpenMhz. Script was designed for calls from Trunk-Recorder but with slight modification can be used with almost any service. 


**Known Issues:**
  - Some .json files are not moved when the rest of the call is handled. Seems to be those that are exactly on the :00 or :30 mark but I haven't found a root cause yet.
